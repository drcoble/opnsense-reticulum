<strong>Best Practices for Transport Nodes:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stationary:</strong> Transport nodes must remain in fixed locations for reliable routing.</li>
<li><strong>Always-on:</strong> Keep transport nodes running continuously for network stability.</li>
<li><strong>Well-connected:</strong> Place transport nodes where they can reach multiple network segments.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic placement:</strong> Only enable transport on nodes that provide connectivity between segments — not on every node.</li>
<li><strong>Announce rates:</strong> Configure per-interface announce rate limits in the Interfaces tab to control bandwidth usage.</li>
</ul>
Transport nodes maintain path tables, forward packets across hops, and propagate announcements throughout the network. They act as distributed cryptographic keystores by caching public keys from announcements.]]></help>
